Reference Implementation of In-Hand Object Rotation for Allegro Hand Platforms

This repository provides an implementation example for in-hand object rotation using the **Allegro Hand Platforms**.  
It combines a ROS2-based hardware controller with an AI-driven manipulation algorithm originally developed for in-hand rotation research.

This implementation currently supports **Allegro Hand V4**, but the software architecture is designed to be modular and extendable.  
As additional robotic hand platforms are developed within our organization, this codebase may be expanded to include **plug-in modules and adapters** for new hardware versions, enabling broader compatibility across future Wonik Robotics hand systems.

This codebase utilizes:
- **Allegro Hand ROS2 Controller**  
  https://github.com/Wonikrobotics-git/allegro_hand_ros2
- **AI Algorithm: In-Hand Object Rotation via Rapid Motor Adaptation (RMA)**
