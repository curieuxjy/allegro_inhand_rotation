Reference Implementation of In-Hand Object Rotation for Allegro Hand Platforms

This repository provides an implementation example for in-hand object rotation using the **Allegro Hand Platforms**.
It combines a ROS2-based hardware controller with an AI-driven manipulation algorithm originally developed for in-hand rotation research.

This implementation currently supports **Allegro Hand V4**, but the software architecture is designed to be modular and extendable.
As additional robotic hand platforms are developed within our organization, this codebase may be expanded to include **plug-in modules and adapters** for new hardware versions, enabling broader compatibility across future Wonik Robotics hand systems.

This codebase utilizes:

- **Allegro Hand ROS2 Controller**
  https://github.com/Wonikrobotics-git/allegro_hand_ros2
- **AI Algorithm: In-Hand Object Rotation via Rapid Motor Adaptation (RMA)**

## Test System Configuration

- Ubuntu 22.04
- ROS2 Humble
- Allegro Hand V4
- IsaacGym 4.0 Simulator

## System Requirements

### 1. Isaac Gym 4.0 Installation

Download: [https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym/download](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym/download)

**Prerequisites:**
```
• Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04
• Python 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8
• NVIDIA driver version 470.74 or newer
• GPU: NVIDIA Pascal or later, with at least 8 GB VRAM
```

### 2. Allegro Hand ROS2 Controller

This project operates based on the official controller:

**👉 [WonikRobotics-git/allegro_hand_ros2](https://github.com/WonikRobotics-git/allegro_hand_ros2)**

Refer to the official repository for detailed installation and setup instructions. You will need this for real-world deployment.

**Prerequisites:**
```
• ROS 2 Humble
• Python 3.10 or later
```

### 3. Python Environment Setup

⚠️ **Important Notice**

Isaac Gym and ROS 2 Humble have **incompatible Python version requirements**:

* **Training Phase (Isaac Gym):** Python 3.6–3.8
* **Deployment Phase (ROS 2 Humble):** Python 3.10+

**We strongly recommend using separate Conda virtual environments:**

```bash
# For algorithm training (Isaac Gym)
conda create -n hora python=3.8
conda activate hora
pip install -r hora_requirements.txt

# For algorithm deployment (ROS 2)
conda create -n allegro python=3.10
conda activate allegro
pip install -r allegro_requirements.txt
```

This separation prevents dependency collisions and ensures stable operation across the full pipeline.

### 4. Verify Installation

**`hora` environment check:**
```bash
conda activate hora
python compare_hands.py  # Shows URDF differences
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="./materials/compare.gif" width="60%" />
</p>

**`allegro` environment check:**
```bash
conda activate allegro
python hora/algo/allegro_ros2.py  # Command interface script
```


## Run

> **Note:** This repository focuses on **Allegro Hand V4 (Right and Left)** versions. The original HORA repository used different fingertip geometries, resulting in slightly different finger lengths. See the comparison images below for details.

### Verify Allegro Right/Left URDF

To verify the URDF configurations for both hands, you can visualize them in Isaac Gym:

```bash
python allegro_right_left.py
```

This script loads both the right and left hand models in a single environment, allowing you to compare their kinematics and collision geometries side by side.

**URDF Files Location:**
- Right hand: `assets/allegro/allegro_right.urdf`
- Left hand: `assets/allegro/allegro_left.urdf`

**Visualization:**

</p>

**Fingertip Geometry Comparison:**

The images above show the differences between the original HORA fingertips and the standard Allegro Hand V4 fingertips used in this repository.

### Configuration Structure

This repository uses [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) for hierarchical configuration management. Configs are organized in `configs/` directory:

- **`config.yaml`** - Main entry point (sets device, physics engine, defaults)
- **`task/*.yaml`** - Environment settings (rewards, randomization, URDF paths)
- **`train/*.yaml`** - Training parameters (PPO hyperparameters, network architecture)

```

**Config Types:**
- **Hora** = In-hand rotation (training/testing)
- **Grasp** = Grasp pose generation only
- **Right/Left** = Hand-specific URDF and grasp caches

**Usage:**
```bash
# Default (AllegroHandHora)
python train.py

# Specific task with overrides
python train.py task=RightAllegroHandHora train.ppo.learning_rate=1e-4
```

### Generate Grasping Poses

To achieve a stable initial grasp, you must prepare reliable grasp poses for the target objects.
According to the [original HORA instructions](https://github.com/HaozhiQi/hora/?tab=readme-ov-file#prerequisite), you can directly download the provided `.npy` grasp pose files for:

* **Allegro Hand V4**
* **HORA internal Allegro Hand** (features slightly longer fingertips than the standard Allegro Hand V4)

We strongly recommend reviewing the original instructions to understand the differences and verify the available data files.

Alternatively, you can generate grasp poses **from scratch** using the scripts included in this repository:

```bash
scripts/gen_grasp.sh 0 # GPU ID
```

This script will run the full grasp-pose generation pipeline and produce the necessary `.npy` files for training or evaluation.

If you have multiple gpus, you can parallelize the process by running multiple instances with different GPU IDs:

```bash
scripts/gen_grasp_multigpus.sh 0 1 2
```


### Train

The training pipeline follows a two-stage approach using **Rapid Motor Adaptation (RMA)** with support for various object shapes (Ball, Cylinder, Cube, etc.).

**Training Stages:**
- **Stage 1**: Teacher policy with privileged observations (object dynamics, external forces)
- **Stage 2**: Student policy using only proprioceptive observations (joint positions, velocities, history)

<p align="center">
  <img src="./materials/training_stages.png" width="80%" alt="Training Process"/>
</p>

> **Note**: The following instructions use **RightAllegroHandHora** as the default task. To train the left hand, modify the `task` parameter in the training scripts to `task=LeftAllegroHandHora`.

#### Stage 1: Teacher Policy Training

Train the teacher policy with privileged information:

```bash
./scripts/train_s1.sh 0 42 my_experiment
# Arguments: GPU_ID SEED RUN_NAME
```

**Quick Training Check**

To quickly test Stage 1 training, the script is already configured with minimal resources. The default settings in `scripts/train_s1.sh` are:

```bash
task.env.numEnvs=4 train.ppo.minibatch_size=32 \
```

#### Stage 2: Student Policy Training (Adaptation)

Train the student policy using proprioceptive adaptation:

```bash
./scripts/train_s2.sh 0 42 my_experiment
# Arguments: GPU_ID SEED RUN_NAME
```


### Test in Simulation

After training, you can test your policy using two methods: **evaluation** (quantitative metrics) and **visualization** (qualitative inspection).

#### Evaluation (Headless)

Runs 10,240 parallel environments in headless mode to measure success rates and performance metrics. All domain randomizations are enabled for robust testing.

```bash
# Stage 1 (Teacher policy)
./scripts/eval_s1.sh 0 my_experiment  # GPU_ID RUN_NAME

# Stage 2 (Student policy)
./scripts/eval_s2.sh 0 my_experiment  # GPU_ID RUN_NAME
```


#### Visualization (Visual Inspection)

Renders 64 environments with GUI to visually inspect policy behavior. Most randomizations are disabled for clearer observation.

```bash
# Stage 1 (Teacher policy)
./scripts/vis_s1.sh my_experiment  # RUN_NAME

# Stage 2 (Student policy with tennis ball)
./scripts/vis_s2.sh my_experiment  # RUN_NAME
```

</p>

### Test in Real-world

Deploy your trained policy to physical Allegro Hand hardware. This requires switching to the `allegro` conda environment (Python 3.10+) for ROS 2 compatibility.

#### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure:
- Allegro Hand(s) connected via USB and powered on
- CAN interface hardware properly installed
- [allegro_hand_ros2](https://github.com/WonikRobotics-git/allegro_hand_ros2) package installed and built
- ROS 2 workspace sourced (`source install/setup.bash`)
- `allegro` conda environment activated (`conda activate allegro`)

#### Step 1: CAN Network Setup

Configure CAN bus interface for hand communication. The bitrate must be set to 1,000,000 for Allegro Hand V4.

**Single Hand (can0 only):**

```bash
sudo ip link set can0 down
sudo ip link set can0 type can bitrate 1000000
sudo ip link set can0 up
```

**Dual Hand (can0 + can1):**

```bash
# Right hand on can0
sudo ip link set can0 down
sudo ip link set can0 type can bitrate 1000000
sudo ip link set can0 up

# Left hand on can1
sudo ip link set can1 down
sudo ip link set can1 type can bitrate 1000000
sudo ip link set can1 up
```

**Verify CAN connection:**
```bash
candump can0  # Should show periodic CAN messages if hand is connected
```

#### Step 2: Launch ROS 2 Hand Controller

Start the ROS 2 controller node that manages hand hardware communication.

**Single Hand:**

```bash
ros2 launch allegro_hand_bringup allegro_hand.launch.py
```

Expected output: Joint state topics published at `/allegroHand_0/joint_states`

**Dual Hand:**

```bash
ros2 launch allegro_hand_bringup allegro_hand_duo.launch.py
```

Expected output: Joint state topics for both hands (`/allegroHand_0/joint_states`, `/allegroHand_1/joint_states`)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Controller command topics differ based on setup:
> - **Single hand:** `allegro_hand_position_controller/commands`
> - **Dual hands:** `allegro_hand_position_controller_r/commands` and `allegro_hand_position_controller_l/commands`

> **Note:** Keep this terminal running. Open a new terminal for the next step.

#### Step 3: Deploy HORA Algorithm

Run the trained policy on the physical hardware. The deployment script loads Stage 2 (student) checkpoints and executes the policy in real-time.

**Single Hand:**

Since previous training examples used `RightAllegroHandHora`, the deploy script defaults to loading from that directory:

```bash
scripts/deploy.sh my_experiment
# Loads: outputs/RightAllegroHandHora/my_experiment/stage2_nn/best.pth
```

**Dual Hand:**

For dual hand deployment, specify checkpoint names for both hands. Each hand loads from its respective training directory:

```bash
# Different experiments for each hand
scripts/deploy_two_hands.sh exp_right exp_left
# Right: outputs/RightAllegroHandHora/exp_right/stage2_nn/best.pth
# Left:  outputs/LeftAllegroHandHora/exp_left/stage2_nn/best.pth

# Same experiment name, different hand directories
scripts/deploy_two_hands.sh my_experiment
# Right: outputs/RightAllegroHandHora/my_experiment/stage2_nn/best.pth
# Left:  outputs/LeftAllegroHandHora/my_experiment/stage2_nn/best.pth
```
